# Vocaloid Chance Ports

A homebrew port of [Vocaloid Chance](https://wobbuu.itch.io/vocaloid-chance)

Supports the following systems:
- 3DS
- Switch
- PSP

Will support the following systems later:
- Wii U
- PS3
- Vita

Unfortunately, due to issues with the framework I am using, Wii U will be heavily delayed until the next version is available.
